## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your local environment:

- Node.js (version 10 or higher)
- npm (version 5.2 or higher)
- Git

## Instruction

1. Clone the repository

First, you need to clone the repository containing the Next.js application onto your local environment. To do this, open your terminal and run the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:keento0809/spa-E-commerce.git
cd spa-E-commerce
```

2. Install dependencies

Next, navigate to the cloned repository and install the required dependencies by running the following command:

`npm install`

This will install all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

3. Start the development server

To start the development server, run the following command:

`npm run dev`

This will start the server and make your application available at http://localhost:3000. You should be able to see the home page of your Next.js application.
